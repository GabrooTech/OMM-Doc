            <p>
                The novel is about boy who have dozens of choices ahead. He is 18 years old high school student with no
                right vision on his head. You need to encourage him to become someone in the life, but really purpose of
                any kind of decision will be to make him financially strong person. He can turn himself in multi- millionaire
                businessman or discover his <strong class="pink">feminine</strong> side. On the path you have choice to decide which scenario suit you
                must. There is pre-game option where you can choice your destiny or on other hand you can let your small
                decisions make path for your life.
            </p>
            <h1 class="safe_place">How game and stats works?</h1>
            <p>
                All Characters have <strong class="brown">relationships</strong> (max 100), which affect your further progress in-game. There are <strong class="pink">femininity</strong>
                and <strong class="blue">masculinity</strong> traits each of them max has 10 and your decisions affect this trait which opens more
                scenarios with all characters. Your trait starts from 0 and moves around. Time goes by events. If one of the
                main events will happen it will automatically skip to the night-sleep time. Moving does not affect time, but
                any kind of interaction does. Sleep's earliest point is 21:00 and the latest one is 04:00. <strong class="money">Money</strong> affects a lot of things
                and there are many ways to earn it. There are also statistics of <strong class="yellow">attractiveness</strong> which can be improved with gym
                workouts and clothes which you wear. Also, there are <strong class="cybersport">cybersport</strong> skills that can be improved on PC with practice.
                There is a maximum of 100 points for it. For starters, you will not have any content with your teammate, but with just
                playing you will be able to reach level 10. One play = +0.5 <strong class="cybersport">cybersport</strong> skill. All characters have 10 parts which
                are activated by reaching a <strong class="brown">relationship</strong> with 10-20-30 and more points. Some characters (mostly mains)
                require other traits like <strong class="yellow">attractiveness</strong> and <strong class="pink">femininity</strong> or <strong class="blue">masculinity</strong> to advance in the story. All game endings
                end with the best client he is the main character. If the path is <strong class="blue">"masculinity"</strong> you will take over all his business and
                become a multi-millionaire or become his cum-slut. <strong class="green">Chores</strong>: weep whole house ($10), Fix your room ($5), go
                on groceries ($15), maw a law ($20), help in the kitchen ($5), clean the pool ($10). During the day max number of <strong class="green">chores</strong> to
                do is 2. Each chore can be done 2 times a week. There are many ways to increase <strong class="brown">relationships</strong>: scenes
                automatically increase them, but only scenes can't maximize <strong class="brown">relationships</strong> for you. You need to increase them with
                more mechanic ways like (complimenting (can be done 3 times a day. Increases 0.5 <strong class="yellow">attractiveness</strong>.), flirting,
                kissing, making out, and having sex) all of them unlock time by time depending on your <strong class="brown">relationship</strong> with the character
                and <strong class="yellow">attractiveness</strong>. All of the interaction has its own level starting with a compliment to max it you need to
                reach 100 with character. After that you can flirt with character next is 200,300,400,500. All characters have their
                own level and one interaction also = +5 of level. But you can't max it if other stats are not in touch. For
                example: to flirt with someone you need 30 <strong class="brown">relationships</strong> to kiss someone you need 40 <strong class="brown">relationships</strong> to make out 60 <strong class="brown">relationships</strong> and to have sex 90 <strong class="brown">relationships</strong>. These mechanic ways can't be used for exploits because anything
                further way of maxing <strong class="brown">relationships</strong> won't affect it if there is any kind of way to max it with scenes. At the
                End of the 0.1 version of the game, all the paths will be summed up and will be calculated if there are more <strong class="blue">domination</strong> paths selected your whole gameplay of the next versions will stand on masculinity, but if more
                paths will be <strong class="pink">submission</strong> next versions of the game will stand on <strong class="pink">femininity</strong>. But if kind of thing happens and
                the sums are the equal player will be able to choose the path himself <strong class="under_construction">(under construction (the characters' amount is
                    unclear))</strong> Soccer skills: you play in the schoolâs soccer team as a striker and the whole teamâs success depends on
                you. However, if you are interest is not <strong class="blue">masculinity</strong> you wonât be able to compete for the division cup, but if
                it is you have striker stats as <strong class="purple">ST</strong> there is a max of 100 points which improves match by match. Many <strong class="blue">masculine</strong>
                paths with characters depend on it. During the game, you will have 10 matches and there is no room for the
                loss. To reach each game you need 10 by 10 <strong class="purple">ST</strong> stats, which can be earned with training with the coach.
                The cup will be won you will manage to win 8 matches from the 10. As we mentioned there are many ways of
                earning <strong class="green">Money</strong> one of them is a gas station one work shift at the gas station will increase 0.5 <strong class="GS">GS</strong> stat and also
                some kinds of events will also increase your <strong class="GS">GS</strong> stats, talking about <strong class="money">Money</strong> before 30 <strong class="GS">GS</strong> you will earn 40$ each
                a shift that can be taken 5 times a week, but skip the whole day from 30 to 60 you will earn 80$ from
                80 to 100 you will earn 120$ and at the end if you will have <strong class="GS">GS</strong> stat maxed you will earn 200$ a day. Another
                way of earning <strong class="money">Money</strong> is a restaurant. Here you can max <strong class="RT">RT</strong> stats as a beginner you will work as a dishwasher
                which earns 20$ a shift from 20 stat points you can start working as a chief helper and earn 50$ a shift, but
                here is a catch when you will reach 50 you have to decide whether or not to continue the job if so you have to
                become hooter, wear girl clothing shave, and everything you will earn 200$ a shift, but will you decide to do
                so, if yes you also have the possibility of improvement on 70 points you can people grope you which will
                make you extra <strong class="money">Money</strong> and sum will be 250 a shift and on 80 you will be able to give hand-job (extra 50$)
                and blow-job (extra 100$) and at the level of 100 you will be able to have sex which will earn you extra
                200$ with the sum of 450$ a shift this is a lot of <strong class="money">Money</strong>, but if your path is not <strong class="pink">feminine</strong> then you have to be stuck
                with being a chef helper and trying to lay with other hooters. <strong class="fitness">Fitness</strong> is also a skill that can be used well it
                increases your <strong class="yellow">attractiveness</strong> and assists you at some point. 1-month gym membership will cost you 200$ and
                one class with a trainer will cost you 10$ each time if you will work alone you will gain 0.5 points if you will
                train with a trainer you will gain 1 point. All 10-20-30 and more <strong class="fitness">Fitness</strong> skills bonus your <strong class="yellow">attractiveness</strong>. For
                For example on 10 you will get +2 on 20 +4 on 30 +6 and so on. When you will 5 points for <strong class="fitness">Fitness</strong> you will not be
                able to gain more. So you have to hair trainer after reaching 10 points you can feel free to train alone but
                instead of 0.5 you will gain 0.2 so keep in mind that trainers are one of the most important individuals. There
                is also one more way to earn <strong class="money">Money</strong> which is programming in the 0.1 version of the game you wont be able to do
                this but after that, you will start learning it 5 first lesson will be free and will help you to introduce into
                that field, but after that you have to do 25 paying lessons which cost 5$ each. After learning the
                programming you will have your first job this is where IT stats come in Max stat is of course 10 one done job
